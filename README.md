This project provided a comprehensive examination of portfolio risk by employing multiple Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodologies—historical simulation, parametric (normal distribution), and Monte Carlo simulation—alongside stress testing and scenario analysis. By analyzing a diversified equity portfolio across ten major publicly traded companies, the study successfully quantified potential losses under both normal and extreme market conditions.

The results showed that the 95% VaR ranged from -2.33% (historical) to -2.48% (parametric), while the Monte Carlo simulation initially produced a significantly higher VaR of -4.55%, attributed to the inclusion of high-volatility periods such as the COVID-19 market crash. At the 99% confidence level, Monte Carlo VaR reached -4.89%, surpassing the historical VaR of -4.51% and parametric VaR of -3.56%. However, when the Monte Carlo simulation was recalculated using data that excluded the COVID spike, the VaR estimates dropped to -2.93% (95%) and -3.02% (99%), aligning more closely with the other methods.

Stress testing further reinforced the need to evaluate extreme events beyond what traditional VaR models capture. Visualizations demonstrated the substantial impact of the COVID spike on return distributions, with a histogram showing that several assets experienced returns ranging between -20% to +15%. This dispersion validated the presence of fat tails and market-wide volatility clustering during crisis periods. Simulated return distributions that excluded the COVID spike were narrower and more consistent, underlining the influence of tail events on risk estimation.

In conclusion, the project underscores the importance of using multiple VaR techniques in tandem with stress testing to obtain a realistic and robust assessment of portfolio risk. It highlights how crisis periods like COVID-19 can distort volatility and risk metrics, potentially leading to overly conservative estimates if not accounted for properly. The findings support a more nuanced approach to risk management—balancing empirical accuracy with scenario flexibility—to better guide investment decisions, capital allocation, and risk mitigation in dynamic market environments.
